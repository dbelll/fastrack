Today's Goals

get rid of ranf() calls in compete and auto_learn

Clean-up CPU version of code

		Do program for straight competition among a list of saved agents

Processing

	init agents
	
	main loop
	
		learning session
			determine parameters for this learning session
			loop through all opponents
				learn against opponent for one episode
			next opponent	
		
		evaluate agents
			report stats
			replicate/vary
			
	repeat main loop for total session count


GPU Code
	check
	optimize
