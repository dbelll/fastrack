Today's Goals

Questions:
	Will replacing poor agents with copies of best agents help or hurt overall learning?
	Will modifying poor agents' parameters help or hurt
	What is the best number of parallel opponents?

To do list:
	Finish varying training_pieces by agent and test the results
	Add varying training_turns by agent
	
	Have agents copy the good agent's parameters if they are doing poorly

Fixes:
	Fix problem with num_pieces of 1 - must check for terminal condition after the first move.

	Add exploration
		- add noise to val_for_state
		- add epsilon
		- modify initial weights to encourage exploration
		
	Profile kernels and optimize
		choose_move is the bottleneck, has incoherent global memory reads
		<done> put *dc_moves into a texture?
	
	Re-organize global memory layout of weights to match shared memory layout
	
	Use twice as many threads in the learn kernel to speed up wgt copying.  The threads beyond
	dc_board_size then do nothing during learning.
	
	Add an alternative benchmark of playing all the opponents (with learning off) - run this in parallel
	
	Create fixed baseline that shows good learning
	
	Test GPUs random move generator
	implement random warm-up on GPU

	Review code for memory leaks oh host and device

	build a program to test agents on set board positions
	
	put dc_opgrid back to constant memory
	
	Use the macros to get values from AGENT data
		
	Reduce the number of arguments by storing the pointer to AGENT *agGPU in constant memory and
	calculating the other pointers from it.
	
	Compete against best agents from previous _2_ rounds
	
	Replicate the best agents with changes to alpha and/or lambda.

	Modify the parameters for worst agents


Todo's

Add ability to have varying num_hidden by agent



Processing

	init agents
	
	main loop
	
		learning session
			determine parameters for this learning session
			loop through all opponents
				learn against opponent for one episode
			next opponent	
		
		evaluate agents
			report stats
			replicate/vary
			
	repeat main loop for total session count


GPU Code
	check
	optimize
