Today's Goals

	Implement GPU version of the code:
		
	(1) Rearrange all wgts so the cell number is the fastest changing index (not hidden node number)

	(2) Create a way to test the Value for State GPU function (and to be able to time it).
	
	(3) Finish the choose_move function
	
	
	
Round up the board size to have optimal alignment of weights in global memory.


Add ability to have varying num_hidden by agent



Processing

	init agents
	
	main loop
	
		learning session
			determine parameters for this learning session
			loop through all opponents
				learn against opponent for one episode
			next opponent	
		
		evaluate agents
			report stats
			replicate/vary
			
	repeat main loop for total session count


GPU Code
	check
	optimize
