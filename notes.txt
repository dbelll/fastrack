Today's Goals


Clean-up CPU version of code

	Use Random number seeds
	
	Parameterize all control values
		compete against self/others probability
		learn session length
		testing period length
		testing parameters
	
	Save agents to file


Processing

	init agents
	
	main loop
	
		learning session
			determine parameters for this learning session
			loop through all opponents
				learn against opponent for one episode
			next opponent	
		
		evaluate agents
			report stats
			replicate/vary
			
	repeat main loop for total session count


GPU Code
	check
	optimize
