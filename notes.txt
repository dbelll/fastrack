Today's Goals


Must do:

	Add opponent fraction = the denominator of the fraction of agents that are used as opponents
		2 ==> each learning session, agents compete against the best 1/2 of the other agents
		4 ==>   "     "       "        "      "       "      "    "  1/4  "  "    "     "
		etc.
		
	Fix standings spreadsheet to accomodate benchmark frequency
	
	On GPU - add multiple, simultaneous learning for each agent with sharing of results.
		Learn vs. each opponent simultaneously, storing the change in weights to global memory
		Calculate total change in weights accross all opponents and update agents weights with the total change

	Test GPUs random move generator
	
	Replicate the best agents with 

Todo's

Add ability to have varying num_hidden by agent



Processing

	init agents
	
	main loop
	
		learning session
			determine parameters for this learning session
			loop through all opponents
				learn against opponent for one episode
			next opponent	
		
		evaluate agents
			report stats
			replicate/vary
			
	repeat main loop for total session count


GPU Code
	check
	optimize
