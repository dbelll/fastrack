Today's Goals


Must do:

//	Have random board generated on CPU and GPU at the start of each learning episode.

	Create a random move function on GPU, matching the CPU version.

	Compete kernel for GPU
	
	Do full-scale learning on GPU
		multiple episodes
		compete against top 1/2
		

Todo's

Add ability to have varying num_hidden by agent



Processing

	init agents
	
	main loop
	
		learning session
			determine parameters for this learning session
			loop through all opponents
				learn against opponent for one episode
			next opponent	
		
		evaluate agents
			report stats
			replicate/vary
			
	repeat main loop for total session count


GPU Code
	check
	optimize
